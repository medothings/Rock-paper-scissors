# The rock paper scissors console project

## What i learnt from creating this page
- How to choose a random word, rock, paper, or scissors
```js
const choices = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"];
  const index = Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length);
```
- To try not to use global variables as much as often in case I use the same name for different variables in different functions
- To use the return function so that I can use the same value in different functions
- How to make a popup so that users can answer a question
```js
prompt("Choose your weapon. Rock, paper, or scissors?");
```
- To use `Shift+control+F` to make the code "prettier" after installing the extension called "Prettier - Code formatter" (Also I'm not very sure if the actual name is "prettier" but my dad calls it that so I will too)
- When writing a loop, the `for loop` is usually when you know how many times to loop the code, and the `while loop` is usually for when you dont know how many times to loop (can't really think of an example right now, so you should probably just go see other people's code)
- When adding a number to a value, use `++` to add one, or `+=[number]`(but without the square bracket)
- For the `if condition`, `and` is written as `&&` and `or` is written as `||`
- Always but the link to js at the end of the html code (but still in the body) because...well...uh... *searches up why* 
  - Ok, so apparently, you have to give the html code to load before linking to js...or something like that
  - Also because if you don't, then the html won't be linked to the js file
- Try to define the functions before you call it
  - Becuase my dad said so
- "==" and "===" are practically the same thing. They both work fine
- Use "const" when you can, use "let" when the variable doesn't change, and don't even think about using "var"
  - Because my dad said so
- 
- Also something interesting I learnt while writing this and the previous READMEs, the "'" is always further than you think it is.
  - I mean, when I'm writing "don't"(even though technically, I should be using do not, though I'm pretty confident that no one likes to read boring files, so I try to keep it casual), I am constantly writing "don;t", then I have to go delete the ";" and then type in the "'"
- Last thing, my dad knows a lot
